 * Feature n or Bug Fix n

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint our team tried creating the basis of the E-Library system. We implemented two of the user stories into C++ code, these include the personalized reading list and the search for text function. Our third user story was going to be implemented but unfortunate circumstances prevented that from happening. We also tried to create a simple front end site as a foundation.  

## Unfinished Work
We were planning on finishing a third user story in this sprint but as previously stated could not get it to completion. So that would make four unfinished user stories, those being: citation tools, recommendations, online library catalog integration, and user login. Although we were only planning on having three user stories completed. 

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint (these functions are in the same file):

 * Reading lists: https://github.com/Jacawb/CPTS_322_Project/blob/main/logic.cpp
 * Search for text: https://github.com/Jacawb/CPTS_322_Project/blob/main/logic.cpp
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
We completed the user stories that we worked on this sprint, therefore we did not have any incomplete issues. Although we only completed two user stories.
 
## Retrospective Summary
