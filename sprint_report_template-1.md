## What's New (User Facing)
 * Feature 1 or Bug Fix 1
 * Feature 2 or Bug Fix 2
 * Feature n or Bug Fix n

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint our team tried creating the basis of the E-Library system. We implemented two of the user stories into C++ code, these include the personalized reading list and the search for text function. Our third user story was going to be implemented but unfortunate circumstances prevented that from happening. We also tried to create a simple front end site as a foundation.  

## Unfinished Work
We were planning on finishing a third user story in this sprint but as previously stated could not get it to completion. So that would make four unfinished user stories, those being: citation tools, recommendations, online library catalog integration, and user login. Although we were only planning on having three user stories completed.

  * Each completed pull request should include a link to a "Before and After" video
  * All team members who contributed to the issue should be assigned to it on GitHub
  * Each issue should be assigned story points using a label
  * Story points contribution of each team member should be indicated in a comment
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
We completed the user stories that we worked on this sprint, therefore we did not have any incomplete issues. Although we only completed two user stories.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  The features we did manage to work on seemed to have turned out well
  We had good collaboration
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   Time management
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * We plan on switching the entire project to Python instead of C++ since it is much better for backend development
